# Randomized_Optimization_RHC_GA_GD_SA
We compare four optimization algorithms (Random Hill Climb, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm, and MIMIC) across different problem sizes, considering fitness scores and execution times. In the Continuous Peaks Problem, Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm excel across various sizes, while Random Hill Climb is optimal for smaller problems.
